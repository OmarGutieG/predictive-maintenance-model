# Predictive Maintenance Model

## Overview
Welcome to the Predictive Maintenance Model project! This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance model using machine learning techniques to anticipate maintenance needs based on inspection data.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze maintenance inspection data, preprocess it, and then train various machine learning models to predict maintenance requirements. The ultimate goal is to identify the most effective model for predictive maintenance tasks.

## Contents
- 'Project data processing.ipynb': Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing.
- 'Project data testing.ipynb': Jupyter notebook containing the code for model training, and evaluation.
- 'project_data.csv': CSV file containing extracted data

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip.
3. Open and run the 'Project data processing.ipynb' notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute data preprocessing steps. This will output a proccesed data file.
5. Open and run the 'Project data testing.ipynb' notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
6. Follow the instructions within the notebook to test different models with different set ups to find the best performing model.
7. Make necessary adjustments or optimizations based on the evaluation results.
8. Utilize the trained model for predictive maintenance tasks in real-world scenarios.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of maintenance inspection records, including various features such as equipment condition, maintenance history, and inspection timestamps. The dataset is stored in CSV format and located in the csv file.

## Model Selection
During the model selection phase, several machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated using cross-validation techniques. The decision tree algorithm exhibited the best performance based on predefined evaluation metrics.
